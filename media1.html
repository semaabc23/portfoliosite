            <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For my final project for this unit I decided to progress on my first project with the album covers. I wanted to explore a culmination of the three different projects we worked on rather than using image averaging simply. My process consisted of me going through multiple music videos from one album and then grabbing snapshots I felt represented the music video and resonated with the album the most. Then I layered the images based on what felt like could produce the best background and played around with photo merging. I wanted to keep the artist's vision present this time and created a visual that held the same idea but represented more of what someone could find in their music videos. I also wanted the color scheme to not be as random as produced with image averaging, thus I played around with color a bit and made sure that parts of the original cover stayed consistent. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the second album cover, I decided to use the original cover as the background and play around with features of the it and replace it with snapshots of music videos. It displayed the original artist's idea more and played around more with the smaller details of the cover.</p>

          <p>
            Approximately 50 college students across the nation were surveyed about their schedules and planning habits. When asked about whether or not they felt their schedule was best suited for them, 73% of them said no. In regards to their preference for a planner, 69% of respondents shared that they preferred to use an online platform, specifically a website, for planning purposes. After being provided a definition of languishing, in response to whether they experienced the feeling, 83% of respondents said yes. When asked about about if their schedule makes them feel burnt out, 65% of people shared that there's at least one day of the week where they feel burnt out because of their schedule.

              After analyzing the interviews, it was evident that a platform that eased the process of scheduling, was stress-free, helped connect different platforms that are used for school, allowed for a time efficient experience, and provided personalized tips to users was the goal. The main features of the website would be: 
            </p>

            After conducting user testing with approximately 15 students, people expressed three main changes that would be important to focus on for the next iteration of the prototype:
          </p>
          <h3>
            More personalization. More welcoming. Emphasizing connectivity.

          </h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            After analyzing the feedback and trying to incorporate the changes. I changed the color palette to brighter colors and incorporated more white space so it would be easy on the eye. I added less on the homepage, but made the main features still apparent. Another change was made in adding a quiz to incoporate more personalization for the scheduling. I also created buttons that were more clearer for the user to be able to tell that they could be clicked on.
